Step 3: Access the Program's Terminal via SSH
Once your Raspberry Pi is running, SSH into it:

ssh comrade@raspberrypi
Now, attach to the running session:

tmux attach-session -t eyes_tcpip
You are now inside the interactive terminal of Eyes_TCPIP.py and can type commands directly.

Step 4: Detach Without Stopping the Program
If you need to leave the session but keep it running, press:

CTRL + B, then D
This detaches you from tmux while keeping the Python program running.

Step 5: Stop or Restart the Program
If you want to stop the running program:

tmux kill-session -t eyes_tcpip
To restart it:

tmux new-session -d -s eyes_tcpip "python3 /home/comrade/Eyes_TCPIP.py"
